Forked from https://github.com/KrystianD/spi-tiny-usb.git . created makefile replaced sum deprecated kernel calls, currently fails to initialize spi but when check is bypassed gpio etc work. Very much a WIP that i have little time for, and usb spi with kernel driver for ftdi ft2232h in my repos works.


spi-tiny-usb
============

SPI interface adapter over USB with Linux kernel module.

NOTE: you need to set your custom VID/PID pair for USB device descriptor as I do not provide any.
